# This is a comment in python because it starts with a # symbol.
# There are 4 primitive data types in Python: 1. Strings, 2. Integers, 3. Floating-Point Numbers and 4. Booleans

# Strings:-
first_name = "Gaurav"
last_name = "Chaudhary"
print("My first name is "+ first_name) # Concatinating strings with + sign does not add a space.
print("My last name is", last_name) # Concatinating strings with , sign does infact add a space.

# Integers:-
age = 20
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.") # Used typecasting here because we can't concatinate a string with an integer.

# Floating-Point Numbers:-
height = 183
print("I am " + str(height) + " cm in height.") # Again used typecasting because can't concatinate a string with a float.

# Blooean:-
human = True
print("Am I a Human? " + str(human)) # And again used typecasting 'case can't concatinate a string with a Boolean.
